Using Flask powered Back-End  to access GEO packages and display results on a React powered Front-End taking advantage of Material UI for a minimalistic design..

**To Run Back end:**
- cd backend
- python3 -m venv .venv
- source  .venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- flask run --no-debugger

- npm start

This runs the app in the development mode. 

**NOTE:** 
You might have to run both the front-end/back-end on a different port so on the prompt select y/yes and Open follow the link to view it in your browser.
